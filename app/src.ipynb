With hands-on experience in full-stack development and a background at Iron Mountain, a competitor in the industry, I bring a unique perspective and a proven ability to contribute to innovative solutions.\\n\\nAt Iron Mountain, I developed and optimized applications using technologies such as ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. A notable project was DevTinder, a full-stack application where I created RESTful APIs, implemented JWT-based authentication, and ensured database integrity through robust data validation. Leveraging tools like Redux for state management and Tailwind CSS for responsive designs, I focused on delivering efficient and user-centric solutions. Additionally, my experience with real-time problem-solving in cloud-based environments has sharpened my ability to tackle challenges effectively.\\n\\nI admire ABBYY’s commitment to intelligent automation and cutting-edge technology. I am confident that my technical skills, coupled with my understanding of the competitive landscape, can drive impactful contributions to your team. I am particularly eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of machine learning and data extraction—areas where ABBYY excels.\\n\\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and insights can align with ABBYY’s goals.

Why React is known as ‘React’?\\nReact is a JavaScript Library. The name ‘React’ was chosen \\nbecause the library was designed to allow developers to react \\nto changes in state and data within an application, and to \\nupdate the user interface in a declarative and efficient \\nmanner.\\nQ ) What is Library?\\nLibrary is a collections of prewritten code snippets that can \\nbe used and reused to perform certain tasks. A particular \\nJavaScript library code can be plugged into application code \\nwhich leads to faster development and fewer vulnerabilities to \\nhave errors.\\nExamples: React, jQuery\\nQ ) What is Framework?\\nFramework provides a basic foundation or structure for a \\nwebsite or an application.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'EP-1.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Inception! \\ue081 Namast e-R e act )\\n3\\nExamples: Angular\\nQ ) Similarities between Library and Framework?\\nFrameworks and libraries are code written by third parties to \\nsolve regular/common problems or to optimise performance.\\nQ ) Difference between Library and Framework?\\nA key difference between the two is Inversion of control. When \\nusing a library, the control remains with the developer who \\ntells the application when to call library functions. When \\nusing a framework, the control is reversed, which means that \\nthe framework tells the developer where code needs to be \\nprovided and calls it as it requires.\\n* Emmet:\\nEmmet is the essential toolkit for web-developers. It allows you \\nto type shortcuts that are then expanded into full-fledged '), Document(metadata={'source': 'EP-1.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Inception! \\ue081 Namast e-R e act )\\n4\\nboiler plate code for writing HTML and CSS.\\nQ ) Create Hello World Program using only HTML?\\nQ ) Create Hello World Program using only JavaScript?\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'EP-1.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Inception! \\ue081 Namast e-R e act )\\n5\\nQ ) Create Hello World Program using only React?\\n* Cross Origin:\\n   The crossorigin attribute in the script tag enables Cross-\\nOrigin Resource Sharing (CORS) for loading external JavaScript \\nfiles from different origin than the hosting web page. This \\nallows the script to access resources from the server hosting \\nthe script, such as making HTTP requests or accessing data.\\nQ ) What is {} denotes in above code?'), Document(metadata={'source': 'EP-1.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Inception! \\ue081 Namast e-R e act )\\n6\\nThis (id=\\'title\\'), classes, etc should come under {}.
