With hands-on experience in full-stack development and a background at Iron Mountain, a competitor in the industry, I bring a unique perspective and a proven ability to contribute to innovative solutions.\\n\\nAt Iron Mountain, I developed and optimized applications using technologies such as ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. A notable project was DevTinder, a full-stack application where I created RESTful APIs, implemented JWT-based authentication, and ensured database integrity through robust data validation. Leveraging tools like Redux for state management and Tailwind CSS for responsive designs, I focused on delivering efficient and user-centric solutions. Additionally, my experience with real-time problem-solving in cloud-based environments has sharpened my ability to tackle challenges effectively.\\n\\nI admire ABBYYâ€™s commitment to intelligent automation and cutting-edge technology. I am confident that my technical skills, coupled with my understanding of the competitive landscape, can drive impactful contributions to your team. I am particularly eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of machine learning and data extractionâ€”areas where ABBYY excels.\\n\\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience and insights can align with ABBYYâ€™s goals.

Why React is known as â€˜Reactâ€™?\\nReact is a JavaScript Library. The name â€˜Reactâ€™ was chosen \\nbecause the library was designed to allow developers to react \\nto changes in state and data within an application, and to \\nupdate the user interface in a declarative and efficient \\nmanner.\\nQ ) What is Library?\\nLibrary is a collections of prewritten code snippets that can \\nbe used and reused to perform certain tasks. A particular \\nJavaScript library code can be plugged into application code \\nwhich leads to faster development and fewer vulnerabilities to \\nhave errors.\\nExamples: React, jQuery\\nQ ) What is Framework?\\nFramework provides a basic foundation or structure for a \\nwebsite or an application.'),\n",
