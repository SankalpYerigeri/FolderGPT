Why React is known as â€˜Reactâ€™?\\nReact is a JavaScript Library. The name â€˜Reactâ€™ was chosen \\nbecause the library was designed to allow developers to react \\nto changes in state and data within an application, and to \\nupdate the user interface in a declarative and efficient \\nmanner.\\nQ ) What is Library?\\nLibrary is a collections of prewritten code snippets that can \\nbe used and reused to perform certain tasks. A particular \\nJavaScript library code can be plugged into application code \\nwhich leads to faster development and fewer vulnerabilities to \\nhave errors.\\nExamples: React, jQuery\\nQ ) What is Framework?\\nFramework provides a basic foundation or structure for a \\nwebsite or an application.'),\n",
